Assignment Title: Polymorphism

Objective: To apply object-oriented programming concepts in Java to create a simple two-person game, reinforcing understanding of class definition, object instantiation, and basic input/output using the java.util.Scanner class.

Instructions:

Consider the definition of the class A. Define a subclass of A named B that overrides method m1() so that it makes m the difference between m and n instead of their sum. Also make the main method print the values shown. Do not change any existing code, just add to it.

class A {
         private int m;
         private int n;
         public A(int mIn, int nIn) {
             m = mIn;
             n = nIn;
         }
         public void m1() {
             m = m + n;
         }
         ...
}

public class B ... {

   ...

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      A a = new A(1, 2);
      A b = new B(1, 2);
      System.out.println(a + " " + b);
      a.m1();
      b.m1();
      System.out.println(a + " " + b);
   }
}   
      
Prints:
A = (1, 2) B = (1, 2)
A = (3, 2) B = (-1, 2)

Submission:

Submit a single .java file containing your implementation of the B class.
Put your names and USP numbers in the program's first line.
If you submit after class, name your file LateB.java.
Ensure your code is well-formatted and adheres to standard Java coding conventions.
