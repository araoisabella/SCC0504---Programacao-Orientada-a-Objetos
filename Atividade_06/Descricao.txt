Assignment: Simple Calculator GUI Application
Objective:
Create a simple calculator GUI application using Java that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This application should allow the user to input two numbers and select an operation to perform. Upon performing the operation, the result should be displayed on the interface.

Requirements:
User Interface:

Use JFrame to create the main window of your application.
Include two text fields for the input of numbers.
Provide four buttons, each representing one of the basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Display the result in a label or a disabled text field when an operation is performed.
Functionality:

Implement action listeners for the operation buttons. When an operation button is clicked, the application should read the input from the two text fields, perform the selected operation, and display the result.
Ensure your application handles division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message in the result field.
Error Handling:

Validate the input to ensure that only numeric values are entered. Display an error message if non-numeric values are entered.
Styling (Optional):

If time permits, students are encouraged to explore different ways to style the GUI components for a better user experience.
Deliverables:
Java source code files for the application.
A short report (10 lines maximum), as a JavaDoc for your main class,  describing the functionality of your application and any challenges you faced.
Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: The application correctly performs all specified operations.
Code Quality: The code is well-organized, commented, and follows Java coding standards.
Error Handling: The application gracefully handles incorrect input and division by zero.
This assignment provides a practical experience with Java's GUI components, focusing on JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and action listeners. It also encourages problem-solving and basic error handling in software development.

Good luck, and have fun building your simple calculator GUI application!
