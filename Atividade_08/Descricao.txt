Enhanced Java GUI Application Assignment: Interactive Color Mixer with Detailed Event Handling
Objective: Build a Java GUI application called "Interactive Color Mixer" that allows users to understand Java's event model through the manipulation of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values using sliders, thereby creating a spectrum of colors. This assignment will specifically focus on the Java event model, emphasizing the use of listeners and event types.

Assignment Description:
Application Setup:

Create a Java project named InteractiveColorMixer.
Initialize the main window (JFrame) with an appropriate title and size.
Interface Components:

Implement three JSlider components, one for each RGB value, each ranging from 0 to 255.
Include a JLabel for each slider to display its current value.
Add a large JPanel to show the mixed color in real-time as the background color. How to set up the background color of a JPanel?
Detailed Event Handling:

Attach a ChangeListener to each RGB slider. Inside the listener, implement the following:
Event Information Logging: Print to the console which slider was moved and the new value. This helps understand the firing of events.
Dynamic Color Update: Adjust the background color of the display panel based on the slider values.
Discuss, in the JavaDoc of InteractiveColorMixer class, the event propagation path by explaining how the ChangeEvent is passed from the GUI component to the listener.
Reset all sliders:

Include a JButton to reset all sliders to a predefined position (e.g., 128, to represent a neutral position).
Mouse Events:
Attach a listener to the JPanel showing the colors to detect mouse events.
Print to the console when the mouse enters and leaves the JPanel's area.
While the mouse is within the JPanel, print its x and y position.
Enhance the GUI by ensuring it is responsive and components resize gracefully when the window is adjusted.

Learning Outcomes:
Deep dive into the Java event model: Gain hands-on experience with ChangeListener and understand how components communicate through events.
Enhanced GUI interaction: Learn to build a responsive and interactive user interface that reacts to user inputs in real time.
Deliverables:
Source code for the InteractiveColorMixer application.
Estimated Time: 50 minutes

This assignment is designed to be engaging and informative, providing students with a deeper understanding of Java's event-driven architecture while allowing them to visually experiment with color theory.
