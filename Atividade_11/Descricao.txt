Exercise: World of Zuul 2
Objective:
Understand the concepts of Cohesion and Coupling and how they contribute to the quality of a Java program.

Assignment Details:
Follow the instructions on the presentation:

Cohesion and coupling in Java.

Instructions:
If we want to add something to a room, it is easier if only the Room class must describe what is inside a room:
public String getLongDescription() {
        return "You are " + description + ".\n" + getExitString();   
}
Edit other parts that describe a room, such as printLocationInfo method (Game class).
Create the command look. Make it, avoiding implicit coupling between classes.
Add 1 item to each room. Use a solution that will not reduce cohesion of Room.
Write a back method that returns to the last room. Write a method to test it that uses the assert command or jUnit.
 Implement the CommandWord class as an enum. Use a value for each command word and one more for unknown commands.
Submit your Java code as a jar or zip file.
Estimated Time: 50 minutes
This assignment is designed based on the concepts covered in Chapter 8 of the book Objects First with Java.
